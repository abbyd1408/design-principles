     <h1>Similarity</h1>
     <p>"Our minds group things with similar properties. such as color or shape. "Like goes with like." (White Space is Not Your Enemy, Pg. 62)</p>
       <p> Using the law of similarity, you can group red cups with red cups, blue cups with blue cups, and yellow cups with yellow cups. This creates organization in the layout and also makes it easier on the eyes.</p>

        <p> This image shows us the use of similarity, and how it relates to our everyday life. In this picture we have two highlighters, two pencils, two black ink pens and two blue ink pens. All of these things are writing tools, but are different in certain ways. </p>
