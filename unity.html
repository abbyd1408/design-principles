     <h1>Unity</h1>
     <p>"The last principle, unity may seem a little abstract compared to the other five principles. Unity means that all the parts of the design work together, and everything looks like it belongs together.A layout is visually unified if it's different parts have visual links or relationships to one another. A good design has some consistency in terms of the pattern of type columns, or rhythm of typography, or style of visuals, etc. Unity refers to oneness, that the result is one cohesive design or visual message." (White Space is Not Your Enemy, Pg. 60)</p>
       <p> In other words, if a picture has unity all the parts are working together, and blending well together to form one image the viewer can understand.</p>

     <figcaption>This is a picture of a football stadium
     </figcaption>
        <p> In this picture you can see the stadium clearly as well as the background, so the viewer would be able to tell this is a football game. You can see the crowds of people in the stands, the lights up top, the smoke from the canyon, and the field in the bottom left corner.</p>
