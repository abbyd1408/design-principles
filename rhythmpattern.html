     <h1>Rhythm/Pattern</h1>
       <p> "A pattern whether regular or irregular, also may create a sort of movement we could call rhythm. Think of music, foot tapping, finger snapping, clapping and dancing. In graphic design, rhythmic movement has to do with repeating items strategically-kind of like a backbeat." (White Space is Not Your Enemy, Pg.59)</p>
       <p> "Repeating a color such as the yellow of the moon photo also can create rhythmic movement. Using columns to keep your legs of type uniform creates rhythm. Grouping serveral photos establishes a rhythm. Repeating your only results throughout a layout generates rhythm." (White Space is Not Your Enemy, Pg. 59) </p>
       <p> Rhythm allows us to understand what the layout is about, and it makes it nice and neat, easy for the eyes to follow and understand.</p>

        <p> This picture here illustrates a small list for a beach trip. This picture illustrates the use of pattern by using two different types of font and two different colors, as well as using columns. This illustrates the use of rythm and movement in layout. There's an easy pattern thats easy to follow. </p>
