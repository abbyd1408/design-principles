     <h1>Focal Point</h1>
     <p>"You'll recall from the works-every-time layout that the visual functions as the eye's point of entry into the layout. That's a focal point, is the most important thing visually in any layout. Sometimes called the principle of emphasis, the focal point is the center of attention in the design or layout. Another term for focal point is center of visual interest or CVI because it focuses the eye's attention." (White Space is Not Your Enemy, Pg. 53)</p>
       <p> In other words, the focal point is meant to be the center of the image, and is meant to draw the viewers gaze to it.The focal point also helps the viewer understand what the image is about. You wouldn't put a bird in the middle of a flyer for a Pie Eating Contest, you would put a pie! </p>

        <p> In this picture, the focal point is the bar. This would be perfect for a flyer for happy hour, or a game at pokernight. This image clearly depicts the bar as the focal point in the image, thus making it perfect to use for a flyer or advertisement. </p>

        <p>In this picture it's very easy to see that the sign is the focal point of the picture. It lies in the middle of the picture and displays information that the viweer can easily interpret. </p>
