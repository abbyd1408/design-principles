     <h1>Proximity</h1>
       <p> "We perceive objects that are close together as belonging to the same group. A related law, the law of Common Fate, says that we perceive objects moving in the same direction as part of the same group. On the left, we interpret one group of circles. On the left, we interpret one group of circles, on the right we interpret two groups of circles. The ability to group content aids in creating organization and order in layouts." (White Space is Not Your Enemy, Pg. 60)</p>
       <p> Using the law of proximity, we can organize the layout in an way we want, which makes it easier for the user to get information from the image. </p>

        <p> This picture demonstrates proximity. You have a total of five cups, but they are in two different groups. A group of three and a group of two. This demonstrates how proximity works by showing how the eye seperates the two different groups.</p>
