     <h1>Continuity</h1>
     <p>"Our minds will continue a pattern beyond it's ending points. Further, our eyes will follow the direction of a line. On the left, our minds see a single cross shape insead of a four shorter converging lines. On the right, our eyes follow the direction of the A's swoop and continue on to the start. Applying this concept can add a sense of direction and movement to your layout. Ergo, flow." (White Space is Not Your Enemy, Pg. 62)</p>
       It's like looking at a rainbow of colors. If you start with a really bright red, and go from orange,to yellow, to darker colors, your eyes will naturally follow the nature of the pattern.

        <p>This picture demonstrates continuity by showing how when shown a pattern, our eyes will naturally follow. In this picture specifically, we have been given sharpies in the order of the rainbow. Starting with red, orange, and transitioning into the other colors. This pattern is completely natural, and is easy for our eyes to follow. </p>
