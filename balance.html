     <h1>Balance</h1>
       <p>"In design, we think of balance in terms of visual weight. You want your designs and layouts to be visually balanced, unless your communication purpose is to unsettle people by making them feel unbalanced and tense or anxious. There are three kinds of visual balance: radial, symmetrical and asymmetrical." (White Space Is Not Your Enemy, Pg.56)</p>
       <p>"Radial balance refers to circular design in witch the fulcrum lies at the center, such as dream catchers in Ojibwa Nation culture. Circular designs, often associated with spiritual meanings, are universal across cultures." (White Space Is Not Your Enemy, Pg.57)</p>
       <p> "To recieve symmetrical balance, each side of a bisected design must be a mirror image of the other in terms of visual weight. This is called formal balance. As with all things formal, symmetrically balanced design has its uses. But it may tend toward the traditional and conservative." (White Space Is Not Your Enemy, Pg.57)</p>
       <p> "Assymetry, then, reveals two unequal sides if bisected. Assymetrical balance tends to be more visually exciting, or at least more visually interesting, than symmetrical balance." (White Space is Not Your Enemy, Pg 57)</p>
       <p> Considering symmetrical balance, in design you want to be able to split the image in half, and have the two halves be mirror image of eachother, thus acheivng symmetrical balance.</p>

        <p> This picture of a nightstand drawer demonstrates the symmetrical aspect of balance. If you were to cut the picture in half, it would be completely even and same on both sides, thus making it symmetrical. Using symmetrical balance as a tool for layout is a very appealing effect, and is easy on the eyes. </p>
